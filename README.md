# Sorting m3u8 File
This respository holds the source code in order that, when run, will download and sort a target .m3u8 file given a valid attribute to sort by.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this program, you must be using Python 3.9.x or greater. 

### Usage
Python allows for compilation and execution of a .py file via the following command:
```console
foo@bar:~/m3u8-Sorting-Problem/$ python main.py
```

However, in the scenario in which you would like to compile the code without execution, please use the following command:
```console
foo@bar:~/m3u8-Sorting-Problem/$ python -m compileall
```

This will create a director called `__pycache__` which will contain a .pyc file. This is the compile code for the main.py file.

If you would like to run the compile code, please use the following command:
```console
foo@bar:~/m3u8-Sorting-Problem/$ python .\__pycache__\<name of compile file>.pyc
```
